                                Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Virginia, U.S.A., without regard to
                                its conflicts of law provisions, and regardless of your location. At its sole
                                discretion, LCI may require you to submit any disputes arising from use of the Website,
                                or breach of these Terms of Use, including disputes arising from or concerning their
                                interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination, to final and
                                binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration
                                Association applying Virginia law. By using the Website, you hereby consent to
                                submission of any dispute to final and binding arbitration.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Waiver and Severability</span>. You agree that
                                if LCI does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
                                these Terms of Use, this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of LCI&rsquo;s rights
                                and that those rights or remedies will still be available to LCI.
                                <p>&nbsp;<br />All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in these
                                    Terms of Use shall survive your acceptance of these Terms of Use and the termination
                                    of these Terms of Use. If any part of these Terms of Use are determined to be
                                    invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision(s) will be
                                    deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the
                                    intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions
                                    shall continue in effect.</p>

                            regarding the subject matter of the same, and supersede all other previous agreements.</p>
